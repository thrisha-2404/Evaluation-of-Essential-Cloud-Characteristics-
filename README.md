# Evaluation-of-Essential-Cloud-Characteristics-
📘 Description:

This mini project focuses on analyzing and evaluating the essential characteristics of cloud computing as defined by the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). The project aims to provide a practical understanding of how these characteristics manifest in real-world cloud environments and services such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

🌩️ Key Characteristics Evaluated:

1. On-Demand Self-Service – Users can provision computing resources automatically without human interaction with the service provider.


2. Broad Network Access – Services are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms.


3. Resource Pooling – Cloud resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model.


4. Rapid Elasticity – Capabilities can be elastically scaled up or down according to demand.


5. Measured Service – Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use through metering and monitoring.



⚙️ Objectives:

To understand the theoretical foundation of cloud computing characteristics.

To evaluate how these characteristics are implemented in leading cloud platforms.

To analyze their role in improving scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency in computing systems.


🧩 Tools and Technologies Used:

Cloud Platforms: AWS, Azure, or GCP (as case studies)

Monitoring Tools: CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, etc.

Documentation and Data Analysis: Google Sheets / Excel / Reports


📊 Outcome:

The project concludes with an evaluation report comparing how each cloud platform implements and supports the five essential characteristics. It highlights the advantages, challenges, and best practices associated with each characteristic.
